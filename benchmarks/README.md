# C Benchmarks

- `obfuscation-benchmarks` [link](https://github.com/tum-i4/obfuscation-benchmarks): Set of unobfuscated C programs offered as a shared benchmark for obfuscation. Looks like it was used in work by Sebastian Banescu, e.g., this [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.726.2419&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
- `samples` [link](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Tigress_protection): Set of unobfuscated C programs used as benchmarks in this [paper](http://shell-storm.org/talks/DIMVA2018-deobfuscation-salwan-bardin-potet.pdf). They use different obfuscations than we do, so I only grabbed the unobfuscated versions.
- `oracle` [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1806799.1806833): Set of obfuscated C benchmarks from the Oracle-Guided Synthesis paper from Sumit.
